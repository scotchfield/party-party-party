Note: If you'd like to create emojis for Slack, make sure your input image is 128x128 (or less) and is max 128kb. Slack is pretty limited.

# Usage

- The first two arguments are always the source image filename, and the file name of the the gif you're creating.
- After that, you can provide an ordered list of transformations. Some transformations take in 1 or more parameters. See the following examples.

## Available transformations

#### Basic Party

The `party` transformation will turn all foreground (non-transparent) pixels multiple colors. This does not take any parameters.

```sh
./bin/ppp smile.png party-smile.gif party
```

```

#### Radius

The `radius` transformation will cause your image to move in a circle. It requires one parameter, which is the radius of the circle.
Note that this may make the image clip with the boundaries.

```sh
./bin/ppp smile.png radius-smile.gif radius:5
```

#### Static

The `static` transformation will cause some pixels of your gif be inverse colors, causing a staticy/interference effect.
This takes in one number parameter, where the higher it is, the more static
A value of 1 means no static. Fractional values are allowed

```sh
./bin/ppp smile.png static-smile.gif static:2.5
```

## Combining transformations

Multiple transformations may be combined by simply adding more to the arguments list. Be aware that the ordering of transformations may affect how things look.

```sh
./bin/ppp smile.png bouncing-party-smile.gif bounce:8 party
```
